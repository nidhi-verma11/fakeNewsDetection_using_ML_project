# fakeNewsDetection_using_ML_project
Project Title: Fake Buster – Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
Project Description:
Developed a Fake News Detection System using Logistic Regression to classify news as real or fake. Preprocessed text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical form. Cleaned the dataset by removing noise such as URLs, HTML tags, and special characters. Achieved high accuracy by optimizing the model with Train-Test Split and tuning hyperparameters.
Technologies Used:
•	Python – Data processing and model development
•	Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing
•	Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
•	TF-IDF Vectorizer – Text data transformation
•	Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
•	Logistic Regression – Classification model
Key Achievements:
✅ Cleaned and processed over 40,000 news articles
✅ Achieved 99% accuracy on test data
✅ Optimized performance using feature extraction and data balancing
